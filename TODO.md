# TODOs

Large-scale TODOs to this project that don't make sense as individual comments in files.

- [ ] Move CSS into `static/site.css`, upload to `cdn.mtn.lu/landing/site.css` and reference it in prod.
- [ ] Switch the GitHub actions model to using [OIDC](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/secure-your-work/security-harden-deployments/oidc-in-aws)
- [ ] Add a link to the source code and AWS bits (always show in dev, show for admins in prod)
- [ ] Make the footer consistent across all templates (i.e. show Git SHA)
