# mtn.lu

My personal blog, which is a custom static site generator written in Dart.

## Usage

To generate a static site in the [`build`](build) directory, run the following:

```shell
dart pub get
./mntnlu.dart
```

To preview the site locally, add the `--serve` flag:

```shell
dart pub get
./mntnlu.dart --serve
```
