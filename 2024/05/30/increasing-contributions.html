    <h1>On increasing contributions</h1>
<time datetime="2024-05-30">May 30, 2024</time>

<p>
  On teams building software, a common question is posed: <em>"how can we get
    more contributions"</em>.
</p>
<p>Putting aside that contributions are not the most
  relevant metric for a team (<a href="https://nesslabs.com/what-gets-measured-gets-managed" title="The fallacy of “what gets measured gets managed”
  ">but perhaps the easiest measured</a>), <em>some</em> form of this question
  is relevant to most teams ("how can we increase our velocity", "how can we
  improve our quality", "how can we increase our impact", etc).
</p>
<p>
  For the sake of this post, we'll assume a few things:
<ul>
  <li>Your product has market fit (users want it)</li>
  <li>Your team is capable of delivering value (you can build it)</li>
  <li>Your team is motivated (you want to build it)</li>
  <li>Your management or sponsors have the resources to support you (incentives)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>... and if any of these are not true, you should probably address them first.</p>
<p>
  Once you have these in place, the number one thing you can do to increase
  contributions is to <strong>make it easier to contribute</strong>, and the
  number one way to do that is to provide the right kind of work for the right
  kind of contributor, henceforth referred to as <em>problems</em>,
  <em>projects</em>, and <em>tasks</em>.
</p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>
  The most straightforward way to increase contributions is to provide <em>tasks</em> which are:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Vetted</strong>: tasks are things your team already wants to do, and
    that you know will be valuable to your users - the only limiting factor is
    the time and effort required to complete them.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Explicit</strong>: the contributor knows what is expected of
    them, and likely even has examples such as existing checked-in code, a draft
    PR with clear TODOs, and/or fast test cases that currently fail and would
    pass upon completion.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Small</strong>: the contributor can complete the task in anything
    from a few hours to a few days. The exact amount of time is not critical,
    but the contributor should be able to see the end of the tunnel at all
    times.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  I notice that tasks are the number one things most teams get wrong. They
  either provide tasks that are too big, too vague, or too unimportant. This
  leads to contributors getting stuck, losing interest, or feeling like they
  are not making a difference. Failure modes include:
<ul>
  <li>
    Only junior or newer contributors are expected to work on tasks, while
    senior contributors almost exclusively work on projects or problems. This
    leads to a lack of mentorship and growth opportunities for junior
    contributors (doing cookie-cutter tasks is not the same as learning from
    someone more experienced), and feelings of imposter syndrome for senior
    contributors (if they are not contributing to the most important work, what
    are they doing?).
    <p>
      <strong>Fix</strong>: ensure there is a range of work available for all levels of
      contributors, and that the work is distributed evenly across the team. If
      there is particularly important work that only senior contributors can
      complete, ensure that there is a clear path for junior contributors to
      grow into that role.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Tasks are poorly triaged, often aspirational ideas (i.e. from a brainstorm
    or TODO) that have not been vetted by the team, which leads to contributors
    spending time on work that is not a priority or that will never be merged.
    <p>
      <strong>Fix</strong>: don't use an issue tracker as a TODO list. Ensure that
      all tasks are vetted by the team, and that they are prioritized, estimated,
      and well-understood before being assigned to a contributor, particularly
      someone new or with less influence on the team. Tasks should be <em>"if there
        was a PR that did X, observable by Y, we would merge it"</em> - not "it would
      be nice if we had X".
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Tasks are too big or speculative, leading to contributors getting stuck or
    losing interest. This is particularly common when the team is not sure what
    the right solution is, or when the task is part of a larger project that is
    not yet well-defined.
    <p>
      <strong>Fix</strong>: break down tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces.
      It is OK for a task to have some "discovery" or "research" component, but
      the contributor should have a clear path (documented tools, test cases,
      sample applications, etc) to follow, and a clear deliverable (a PR, a
      <em>brief</em> document, a prototype, etc) to produce.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  It's worth noting that <em>creating</em> the tasks is valuable work in itself,
  and should be done by the team as a whole, not just the person who is
  responsible for the work. This is particularly important for tasks that are
  not directly related to the product, such as documentation, testing, or
  community engagement.
</p>
<p>
  A maturing contributor will start to move from working on tasks to defining
  some tasks for themselves, and eventually to defining tasks for others. This
  is a natural progression, and should be encouraged by the team, but it is
  important that the <strong>team as a whole is responsible for the work</strong>.
</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>
  <em>Projects</em> are defining and completing (though not necessarily by the
  same person) a set of tasks that accomplish a specific goal. Projects are
  larger than tasks, but smaller than problems, and are often used to group
  related tasks together, or to provide a clear path for a contributor to
  follow. They should be:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Scoped</strong>: projects should have a clear goal, a set of
    tasks that will accomplish that goal (or a clear path to discovering
    them), and a set of criteria that will determine when the project is
    complete.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Resourced</strong>: a clear owner, a regular cadence of
    check-ins, and a set of resources (time, money, people) that are dedicated
    to the project. This is particularly important for projects that are
    cross-cutting or that require coordination between multiple teams.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Noisy</strong>: projects should be visible to the team,
    and should be regularly updated with progress, blockers, and next steps.
    This is particularly important for projects that are long-running or that
    require coordination between multiple teams.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Failure modes include:
<ul>
  <li>
    Projects have no centralized ownership or accountable person, leading to
    newer contributors churning without sufficient guidance, or to senior
    contributors feeling like they are doing "busy work" that is not directly
    contributing to the team's goals.
    <p>
      <strong>Fix</strong>: ensure that every project has a clear owner, and
      that the owner is responsible for ensuring that the project is completed
      on time, on budget, and to the team's satisfaction. This does not mean
      that the owner has to do all the work, but they should be responsible for
      ensuring that the work gets done.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Projects are vague, often originating from a top-down mandate or
    suggestion by an influential member of the team, but without a clear
    goal, set of tasks, or criteria for completion. This leads to projects
    that are never completed, or that are completed but do not provide value
    to the team or the users.
    <p>
      <strong>Fix</strong>: projects should be carefully considered (beyond a
      short prototyping phase), and be explicitly <em>accepted</em> by the team,
      and by other teams or dependencies that are likely to be needed.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  Projects are a natural progression from tasks, and should be used to group
  related tasks together, or to provide a clear path for a more experienced
  contributor to follow. Often your team's velocity will be determined by the
  number of projects you can complete in a given time period, and the quality
  of those projects.
</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>
  <em>Problems</em> are the highest level of work, and are often used to
  describe a user need, a business goal, or a technical challenge that the team
  is facing. Problems are too large to be completed by a single person, and
  often too complex to be fully understood at the outset. They should be:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Challenging</strong>: problems should be difficult, but not
    impossible. They could require the team to stretch (i.e. learn new skills
    or technologies), but should not require the team to break (i.e. work
    nights and weekends, or sacrifice quality or safety).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Important</strong>: problems should be valuable to the team or
    the users, and should be aligned with the team's goals and values. They
    should be worth the time and effort required to complete them.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Limited</strong>: it is dangerous to have too many problems
    open at once, as this can lead to a lack of focus, or to the team feeling
    overwhelmed. Problems should be carefully considered, and only opened when
    the team is ready to commit to solving them.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Failure modes include:
<ul>
  <li>
    Problems are seen as something to be "claimed" rather than "solved",
    leading to a lack of ownership or accountability, or to a lack of
    collaboration or coordination between team members.
    <p>
      <strong>Fix</strong>: reward the team for solving problems and
      collaborating across teams and disciplines.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Problems are seen as "too big" or "too vague" to be solved, leading to
    the team feeling overwhelmed or paralyzed, or to the team feeling like
    they are not making progress.
    <p>
      <strong>Fix</strong>: ensure appropriate stakeholders are intimately
      involved in defining the problem, and that the team has the autonomy
      and resources to solve it.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
  In conclusion, the number one thing you can do to increase contributions is
  to make it easier to contribute, and the number one way to do that is to
  provide the right kind of work for the right kind of contributor. This means
  providing <em>tasks</em> that are vetted, explicit, and small, <em>projects</em>
  that are scoped, resourced, and noisy, and <em>problems</em> that are
  challenging, important, and limited.
